      "money": 290,
      "details": "A used clothing drive is a compassionate and sustainable initiative aimed at collecting gently worn clothing items from the community. These collected garments are then redistributed to those in need, often including disadvantaged individuals and families, as well as those affected by disasters. Such drives serve several purposes: reducing textile waste, extending the life of clothing, and addressing clothing insecurity. They also foster a sense of community, encouraging people to give back. Often organized by nonprofits, schools, or community groups, these drives exemplify the spirit of generosity and social responsibility, making a positive impact on both the environment and the lives of recipients."
